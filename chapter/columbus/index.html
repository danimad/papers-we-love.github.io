<p>What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research publication with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Otherwise, just come, listen, learn, and discuss.</p>

<p>We'll be using <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">papers-we-love's curated repository</a>. Please contribute by adding PR's for papers, code, and/or links to other repositories.</p>

<p>PWL Columbus strictly adheres to the <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a> set forth by all PWL charters.</p>

          <p>Online tax preparation or financial advice sounds like a viable business, but "secure" sites are broken every day. Consumers are rightly wary of disclosing their personal information to cloud-based service providers. How can you build a service which delivers real value and is backed by a hard, cryptographic guarantee of security?</p> <p>

What if it were possible for a customer to give their data to a cloud provider in encrypted form, and for that provider to perform useful computations on that data without ever decrypting it? The results would be delivered to the customer, encrypted with a key that only they knew. It sounds like an ideal solution, but maybe impossible?</p> <p>

This is the promise of homomorphic encryption. The idea has been around for some time, but it was considered intriguing but maybe not possible until Craig Gentry's groundbreaking thesis. Gentry later published a much more accessible paper called "Computing Arbitrary Functions of Encrypted Data".</p> <p>

          <p>Do a web search for "Out of the Tar Pit," and you'll find 1) <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/design/out-of-the-tar-pit.pdf?raw=true">the paper itself</a> and 2) a long list of "top 10 papers every programmer should read" type blog posts citing it. The premise of the paper is certainly ambitious: Explain why developing and maintaining large software systems is hard, and how to fix it. </p> <p>Amazingly, this 10 year old paper mostly delivers. Perhaps even more surprisingly, however, its clear explanation, high citation count, and relatively straightforward prescription for dealing with complexity have not translated into a correspondingly large influence on mainstream programming tools and frameworks (with certain notable exceptions, such as the Clojure community). </p> <p>In a sense, then, reading the paper informs us not only of the authors' strategy for building large, maintainable systems, but of our own community's ability to digest useful b…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Columbus/events/189943332/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Thanks for your interest in Papers We Love Columbus! </p> <p>For the first meeting we expect to spend some time getting logistical kinks worked out, so rather than trying to recruit a legendary speaker to present a difficult paper, we are making the meeting pretty informal. </p> <p>This is a chance to meet people in Columbus interested in computer science research and to begin to plan the future of the group. Please bring along a copy of a paper you've enjoyed to give away, and you can leave with a copy of someone else's favorite!</p> <p>I'll try to organize food if enough people RSVP. </p>… <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Columbus/events/187569892/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>
