          <p>What happened in the basements of the AI lab at MIT in the late '50 is truly inspiring and this paper is telling us that story. Herbert Stoyan spent many years researching those early days and even McCarthy is pointing at his work in his papers!</p> <p><br>Lisp is one of the oldest languages out there. When I started learning about functional programming, I got interested in why Lisp languages are what they are today, what's the relationship with AI, what lambda calculus has to do with this, or why I kept hearing things like "Lisp has failed".</p> <p>Surprisingly, many concepts that we give for granted in functional programming today were there almost 60 years ago! </p> <p>The paper is quite accessible and a good start for the new season of PWL. Some Lisp sources will be presented but there is no need to have a deep knowledge of the language.

Finally, a breakthrough came by sharing ideas from category theory to bring monads into functional programming, as a way to model and manage side effects. However, little has been done to ensure that entire interaction sequences <i>make sense</i>. For example, many functional programming languages will allow you to open a file handle, close it, and then try and read from it - clearly a nonsensical sequence of operations! In "Kleisli Arrows of Outrageous Fortune", Conor McBride shows us how we can borrow more ideas from the literature, introducing a new formulation of <i>indexed monads</i> - a structure with close connections to slice categories. Given these new tools, he demonstrates that these monads can correspond to enf…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-London/events/222094026/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Relational programming, or logic programming, is a programming paradigm that exhibits remarkable and powerful properties, to the extent that its implementation seems frightfully daunting to the layman. µKanren is a minimal relational language that seeks to strip the paradigm down to its core, leaving us with a succinct, elegant and above all <i>simple</i> set of primitives on top of which we can rebuild even the most powerful relational constructs.</p> <p>In this talk, we will explore the µKanren language by implementing it from first principles in a simple functional programming language, going on to demonstrate how you can assemble these simple building blocks into a semblance of its richer parent, miniKanren, and maybe solve a logic puzzle or two to make sure it’s working as advertised.</p> <p>The µKanren paper, and the original µKanren implementation, were authored by Jason Hemann and Daniel P. Friedman. The paper is available at </p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-London/events/220542230/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

Many modern statistics and machine learning problems can be recast as optimization problems where we look to minimize a convex objective function.</p> <p>The resulting objective function enforces a set of desirable properties which we wish our answer to possess: a popular example would be sparsity (i.e., we wish to obtain a sparse answer for reasons of interpretability or for other reasons).</p> <p>However, it is often the case that minimizing such objective functions is difficult. While there …</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-London/events/218580993/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p><b>Equal Rights for Functional Objects, or, The More Things Change, the More they Stay the Same</b></p> <p>There are many ways of defining equality, particularly in a language which has both object-oriented and functional aspects. There's reference equality, numerical equality, shallow list equality, deep list equality, string equality, and even "fuzzy" floating-point equality. Which is the right to choose in any given situation? Which should i use for my equals() method on my custom object?</p> <p>This paper answers all of these questions, by taking a seemingly complex problem and revealing an underlying simplicity. It does this by defining one equality operation that works in any situation.</p> <p>The paper makes use of lisp syntax, but the ideas are applicable to most modern languages.</p> <p>
