<p>The Winnipeg chapter of Papers We Love</p>

<p>What was the last paper within the realm of computing you read and loved? What did it inspire you to build or tinker with? Come share the ideas in an awesome academic/research paper with fellow engineers, programmers, and paper-readers. Lead a session and show off code that you wrote that implements these ideas or just give us the lowdown about the paper. Otherwise, just come, listen, and discuss in a low ego, friendly environment.</p>

<p>Papers We Love has a <strong><a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md">Code of Conduct</a></strong>. Please contact one of the Meetup's organizers if anyone is not following it. Be good to each other and to the PWL community!</p>

ACM, 2014<i><br></i></p> <p><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p>Recent studies on Website Fingerprinting (WF) claim to have found highly effective attacks on Tor. However, these studies make assumptions about user settings, adversary capabilities, and the nature of the Web that do not necessarily hold in practical scenarios. The following study critically evaluates these assumptions by conducting the attack where the assumptions do not hold. We show that certain variables, for example, user’s browsing habits, differences in location and version of Tor Browser Bundle, that are usually omitted from the current WF model have a significant impact on the efficacy of the attack.

SHANNON</p> <p><b>Published: </b>1948</p> <p><br><b>Abstract:</b></p> <p>A method is developed for representing any communication system geometrically. Messages and the corresponding signals are points in two “function spaces,” and the modulation process is a mapping of one space into the other. Using this representation, a number of results in communication theory are deduced concerning expansion and compression of bandwidth and the threshold effect. Formulas are found for the maximum rate of transmission of binary digits over a system when the signal is perturbed by various types of noise. Some of the properties of “ideal” systems which transmit at this maximum rate are discussed. The equivalent number of binary digits per second for certain information sources is calculated.</p> <p><br><b>Presenter Bio:</b></p> <p>Jay Smith is an Information Security Consultant with Online Business Systems’ Sec…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Winnipeg/events/227942585/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

The features are invariant to image scaling, translation, and rotation, and partially invariant to illumination changes and affine or 3D projection. These features share similar properties with neurons in inferior temporal cortex that are used for object recognition in primate vision. Features are efficiently detected through a staged filtering approach that identifies stable points in scale space. Image keys are created that allow for local geometric deformations by representing blurred image gradients in multiple orientation planes and at multiple scales. The keys are used as input to a nearest-neighbour indexing method that identifies candidate object matches.

<i>The creation of interactive worlds, such as those in video games, often include a set of computer controlled characters that must intelligently act and react in response to dynamic input from the user. These interactive behaviours usually require authors to programmatically define each behaviour, reaction, and interaction the character should take in response to user input across a range of scenarios, a process that can take significant time. While this method can successfully create robust characters, the large development overhead is not conducive to the exploration, prototyping, and testing of new character ideas.</i></p> <p><i>We designed and developed PaintBoard, a system that enables users to…</i></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Winnipeg/events/220117454/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>
