          <p>Property testing has risen to popularity in the past years due to its ability to find edge cases and other hard to reproduce bugs. But for programmers new to property testing it can be difficult to see how to use property tests to exercise entire systems.</p> <p>In this paper we'll look at a real world use case for property tests and examine the tools and techniques used by the authors to find and reliably reproduce race conditions in a concurrent, distributed system.</p> <p>Chris is a software engineer building services and applications for Le Tote.  Although he started out writing C for embedded systems, these days he spends his time in Elixir, Haskell, Elm, and Rust.  When not writing code for work, Chris can be found writing code for fun, talking about the joys of functional programming, playing pinball, roasting coffee, or building lego with his kids.</p> <p><br><a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.724.3518&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Link to Paper&lt;…</a></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Chattanooga/events/238807283/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>In recent years, supervised learning with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work, the authors attempt to bridge the gap between supervised learning and unsupervised learning using CNNs.</p> <p>This paper introduces the concept of DCGANs, which are neural networks that are trained to distinguish interesting structures and meaning from raw image data by competing with one another. In particular, the networks that are presented appear to be a strong candidate set for unsupervised learning of features for use in realistic image generation.&gt;&gt;We’ll explore convincing evidence that the DCGAN pair used here learns a hierarchical representation of the features held within images ranging from objects to entire scenes. Additionally, we’ll explore the use of these learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as generic image…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Chattanooga/events/237702021/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Recent advances in AI have yielded some impressive results. The use of deep neural networks in particular have led to astounding gains; machines have now approached or surpassed human ability at tasks such as object recognition, video games, and board games.</p> <p>Despite their biological inspiration and performance achievements, these systems differ from human intelligence in crucial ways. Humans still excel at learning quickly from only a handful of examples, and applying knowledge to novel situations.</p> <p>Can reverse engineering human intelligence usefully inform AI and machine learning? The authors believe so, and offer a set of core ingredients that could pave the way for even more human-like, and powerful, AI.</p> <p>Stephen Spalding is a technologist, cyclist, and Chattanooga native.

          <p>Much AI/ML research focuses on building systems that excel in a narrow area (image recognition, planning, motor control, NLP).  While there is tremendous benefit there, it's also interesting to consider building autonomous agents which combine multiple subsystems (NLP, Planning, etc).</p> <p>Josh Marlow is a startup-addict.

"Statistics for Engineers" surveys common statistical techniques for extracting useful, actionable information from the engineering data we regularly generate and encounter.</p> <p><b>About the Author:</b></p> <p><b>Heinrich Hartmann</b> is chief data scientist for Circonus. He earned his PhD in pure mathematics from the University of Bonn (Germany) on geometric aspects of string theory and worked as a researcher for the University of Oxford (UK) afterwards. In 2012 he transitioned into computer science and worked as an independent consultant for a number of different companies and research institutions. He is now leading the development of data analytics for the Circonus monitoring product.</p> <p>
