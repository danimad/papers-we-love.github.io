Language modularity refers to the ability to combine independently developed languages without changing their respective definitions. A language is not anymore a fixed quantity, instead it can be extended with domain-specific constructs as needed. Projectional editing refers to a technique of building editors and IDEs that avoid the need for parsers. They support a wide range of tightly integrated notations including textual, symbolic, tabular and graphical. In addition, by avoiding parsers, the well-known limitations of grammar composition are avoided as well."</p> <p><b>David Graunke presents <a href="http://matt.might.net/papers/might2011derivatives.pdf">Parsing with Derivatives</a>…</b></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/239026973/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Error rates across one of Facebook’s sites were spiking. The problem had first shown up through an automated alert triggered by an in-memory time-series database called Gorilla a few minutes after the problem started. One set of engineers mitigated the immediate issue. A second group set out to find the root cause. They fired up Facebook’s time series correlation engine built on top of Gorilla, and searched for metrics showing a correlation with the errors. This showed that copying a release binary to Facebook’s web servers (a routine event) caused an anomalous drop in memory used across the site</p> <p>Open source version: <a href="https://github.com/facebookincubator/beringei" class="linkified">https://github.com/facebookincubator/beringei</a></p> <p>Lazy people paper summary: <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/s/blog.acolyer.org/2016/05/03/gorilla-a-fast-scalable-in-memory-time-series-database/amp/" class="linkified">https://www.google.com/amp/s/blog.acolyer.org/2016/05/03/goril…</a></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/237408130/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

New Directions in Cryptography introduced the idea of digital signatures and public key cryptosystems, and reduced both problems to the search for a trap-door one-way permutation. Although Diffie and Hellman were unable to come up with such a permutation (settling for "just" Diffie-Hellman-Merkle key exchange), they laid the theoretical framework and invited others to join the search. Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman read the paper, did a lot of hard thinking, and a year later published A Method for Obtaining Digital Signatures and Public-Key Cryptosystems - now known as the RSA algorithm.</p> <p>David works on Infrastructure Security for Salesforce.com.</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/235992744/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Many prior efforts have suggested that Internet video Quality of Experience (QoE) could be dramatically improved by using data-driven prediction of video quality for different choices (e.g., CDN or bitrate) to make optimal decisions. However, building such a prediction system is challenging on two fronts. First, the relationships between video quality and observed session features can be quite complex. Second, video quality changes dynamically. Thus, we need a prediction model that is (a) expressive enough to capture these complex relationships and (b) capable of updating quality predictions in near real-time. Unfortunately, several seemingly natural solutions (e.g., simple machine learning approaches and simple network models) fail on one or more fronts. Thus, the potential benefits promised by these prior efforts remain unrealized. We address these challenges and present the design and implementation of Critical Feature Analytics (CFA). The design of CFA is driven by domain-specif…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/230398379/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

This paper presents Chord, a distributed lookup protocol that addresses this problem. Chord provides support for just one operation: given a key, it maps the key onto a node. Data location can be easily implemented on top of Chord by associating a key with each data item, and storing the key/data item pair at the node to which the key maps. Chord adapts efficiently as nodes join and leave the system, and can answer queries even if the system is continuously changing. Results from theoretical analysis, simulations, and ex- periments show that Chord is scalable, with communication cost and the state maintained by each node scaling logarithmically with the number of Chord nodes."</p> <p></p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/227211670/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

We're starting to build up a decent backlog of topics, I've heard from a couple interested people who have trouble making the usual Thursday timeslot, so I figured it might be fun to try a second event in January on a different night of the week to spread the love around. For the moment I'm only committing to one, but if it's a hit maybe we'll turn it into a regular thing. Let me know your feelings on the subject, if you have them!]</i></p> <p>Denis Rystsov will present "Scalable Atomic Visibility with RAMP Transactions" by Peter Bailis, Alan Fekete, Ali Ghodsi, Joseph M.

At this scale, small and large components fail continuously and the way persistent state is managed in the face of these failures drives the reliability and scalability of the software systems.

<b>Abstract</b></p> <p>





Bigtable is a distributed storage system for managing structured data that is designed to scale to a very large size: petabytes of data across thousands of commodity servers. Many projects at Google store data in Bigtable, including web indexing, Google Earth, and Google Finance. These applications place very different demands on Bigtable, both in terms of data size (from URLs to web pages to satellite imagery) and latency requirements (from backend bulk processing to real-time data serving). Despite these varied demands, Bigtable has successfully provided a flexible, high-performance solution for all of these Google products. In this paper we describe the simple data model provided by Bigtable, which gives clients dynamic control over data layout and format, and we describe the design and implementation of Bigtable.</p> <p>

          <p>After a long reign as the dominant on-disk data structure for databases and filesystems, B-trees are slowly being replaced by write-optimized data structures, to handle ever-growing volumes of data. Some write optimization techniques, like LSM-trees, give up some of the query performance of B-trees in order to achieve this.</p> <p>This time I will cover B-Trees, LSM Trees and Fractal Trees papers and provide some real world use cases (and data) along with the a discussion on the respective papers.</p> … <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Seattle/events/215859342/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>
