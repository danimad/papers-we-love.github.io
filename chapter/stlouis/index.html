          <p>We argue, though, that deeply buried within that 265- line miniKanren implementation is a small, beautiful, relational programming language seeking to get out. We believe µKanren is that language.</p> <p><br>In this presentation we will discuss µKanren, a relational language in the family of miniKanren. We will discuss the basics of relational programming, variable binding, and the strategy that µKanren uses for backtracking. We will explore these concepts using elm-microkanren[2]. Finally, we will briefly cover the work needed to bring µKanren into feature parity with miniKanren using my own extensions to elm-microkanren (plus error handling and named variables.)</p> <p>Brian Hicks is the CTO of Asteris, a devops consultancy based in St. Louis, MO.

          <p>In the spirit of April Fool's we'll be doing a slightly different format this month. This meeting will consist of 5 minute lightning talks on "papers I hate". The meaning of this is completely open to your own interpretation, but some possible ones could be:<br>1) papers I "hate" -- A tongue in cheek roast of a paper you really like.<br>2) "papers" I hate -- A talk on something you dislike that isn't really a paper, but is kind of one. This can be tongue in cheek or earnest.<br>3) "papers I hate" -- A paper you actually dislike, but please keep it lighthearted.</p> <p>We're removing the rule that you can't speak on a paper you published. If you want to lovingly bash your own work and think it would be fun for all then go for it. Also, if you choose to reinterpret "papers" for your talk we can also loosen the rule that the paper should be published as it would not make sense otherwise.</p> <p>I apologize for the short notice on this change in format, but if you were in the meeting…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-in-saint-louis/events/239097908/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Join us to learn about the frontier of Bayesian methods and probabilistic machine learning: Bayesian nonparametrics. We will introduce you to both the mathematical and computational aspects of the most important such model, the Chinese Restaurant Process. CRP is a fully probabilistic, generative model of clustering. First we will explore the theory and applications in both equations and plain-language graphical examples. Then we’ll tell you our story of woe and ultimate triumph in translating this powerful paper into software for big data through 7 rounds of performance optimization rewrites in Scala. Even if you’re not using CRP, these time-honored strategies for speeding up complex calculations will help you unleash your statistical models on big data.</p> <p>Cibo Technologies is a Computational Agronomy startup using daily, planetary-scale agricultural models to improve farms, commodity trading and global supply chains.

          <p>A homomorphic encryption scheme is one that allows computations to be carried out on ciphertext.  The idea is the following: I have two integers a and b and I want to encrypt them in a special way, one that allows YOU to use ENCRYPT(a) and ENCRYPT(b) to compute a third value x such that DECRYPT(x) = a+b - in other words, you have computed a+b for me and I didn't even have to tell you what a or b were!  Such a scheme would have a great many applications but the quest to construct one was mostly fruitless until just a few years ago.</p> <p>In my talk, I'll start by explaining what a homomorphic encryption is, why the "fully" in my title is an important qualifier, and go into a few of the many reasons that homomorphic encryption is a big deal.  I will then talk a bit about recent progress in this area with specific focus on the  (linked) papers <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2009/616.pdf">Fully Homomorphic Encryption over the Integers</a> and </p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-in-saint-louis/events/237047272/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Excerpt from Kevin:</p> <p>Yes the title sounds all biologyish-chemistryish but it's really a theoretical biology paper, which mostly means building fairly simple mathematical models of physical processes (with some numerical simulations). Parts of it are mathematically challenging but those parts can be glossed over without missing much.</p> <p>If you look at the paper and it's too scary, don't worry. I'll do my best to explain what I love about this paper, but maybe you can read this 2-page review?
