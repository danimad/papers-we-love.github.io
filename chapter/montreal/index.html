          <p>Peter Zion will present two great papers on deep learning; first, Yann LeCun’s seminal 1998 paper, "<a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/lecun-01a.pdf">Gradiant-Based Learning Applied to Document Recognition</a>", which will give some background and context for Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton's 2012 paper, "<a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~fritz/absps/imagenet.pdf">ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</a>", in which (to quote Peter), "they [...] create a GPU-based DNN that is better at image recognition than any human".</p> <p>


Given the length of the first paper, I recommend reading Krizhevsky's paper in detail, and skimming LeCun's paper as needed for background.</p> <p>


Everyone interested in machine learning, image processing and recognition, or GPU computing should come!</p> <p>

          <p>Pablo Duboue will present "<a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/zero.pdf">Structural Zeros versus Sampling Zeros</a>" by Mohri and Roark; this looks like a fascinating paper with applicability to improving all kinds of probabilistic models.  He will also be talking about the specific application of this idea to probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) parsing as discussed in another Mohri and Roark paper, "<a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/spcfg.pdf">Probabilistic Context-Free Grammar Induction Based on Structural Zeros</a>".  Anyone interested in machine learning, natural language processing, parsing in general, even automated test generation and model checking, or all kinds of other topics should definitely attend!</p> <p>



I apologize for the delay in announcing this meetup.  I was in Toronto checking out their PWL chapter to hopefully borrow some ideas (and speakers!) and lost track of time.</p> <p>


Note that since Radialpoint have kindly offered to host again,…</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Montreal/events/220974427/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>Guy Dumais will present <a href="http://www.xuanhui.me/pub/wsdm427-kang.pdf">"Learning to Rank with Multi-Aspect Relevance for Vertical Search" by Kang et al.</a>, which presents machine learning approaches to ranking the results of a query based on an aggregate of metrics whose combined weight is not well-defined.</p> <p>



While the relevance of this to people involved in machine learning or targeted search is clear, I would imagine there will be interesting discussion for anyone who has to deal with problems where heuristics are hard to come up with ahead of time.</p> <p>
