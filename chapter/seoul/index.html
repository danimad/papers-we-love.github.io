          <p>We've all heard it: Asia is the future of technology. Over the past few decades, the Asian region has exploded in technological growth from cell phone hardware to call centers to software shops. </p> <p>But where does UX fit into the conversation? Why do Asian websites look so different than any other sites in the world? Why has adoption of UX methodologies been so slow in Asia?</p> <p><br>In this presentation, Ben Kim from Apical Design will share his thoughts on the State of UX in Asia. He will draw from his experiences hosting several lectures in the region and multiple first-hand interviews with Asian designers. He'll also talk about how to bring a UX culture within your organizations. </p> <p>By the end, attendees will have a better understanding of how UX has progressed in the region and the tremendous possibilities moving forward.</p> … <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/seoul-tech-society/events/238318902/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>

          <p>A talk about the light and dark side of UX in the travel industry and how companies encourage us to day-dream about holidays whilst tricking us into purchasing things we don’t need.</p> <p><br><b>About the talk</b></p> <p>It’s been just over a 100 years since the first commercial passenger flight and what a century it’s been! In this talk we’ll discover the ways in which technology defines the way we plan our local and international adventures and how companies invest in UX that enables (and annoys) us in the process.</p> <p>• Have you ever been frustrated in the middle of booking a flight when you suddenly realise the price has doubled and you're paying for travel insurance you didn’t ask for and a seat you didn’t choose?</p> <p>• Have you ever wondered why airlines make such an effort to sell you rental cars and hotels?</p> <p>• Do you want to see some split testing results that reveal some interesting user behaviour?</p> <p><br>At the end of the talk we’ll open up a discussion …</p> <p><a class="event-read-more" href="https://www.meetup.com/seoul-tech-society/events/231263992/">Read more about this Meetup</a></p>
